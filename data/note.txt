NOTE: To convert a dataset to vtk use
 
	>> h5tovtk data.h5:"<path_to_dataset>" 

For example if the dataset is "/Time = 0.1/Temperature" in file Data.h5 then the command would be

	>> h5tovtk Data.h5:"Time = 0.1/Temperature"

This output a file named "Data.vtk" but another name may be specified with the -o option
